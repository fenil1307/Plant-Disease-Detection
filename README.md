# Plant-Disease-Detection
# Overview
The goal of plant disease detection using Keras, TensorFlow, and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) is to build a model capable of classifying diseases in tomato leaves from images. The model underwent training across different epochs, specifically 10, 30, and 50 epochs. Interestingly, the highest accuracy was achieved when the model was trained for 50 epochs, surpassing the performance of models trained with fewer epochs. This suggests that a more extended training duration, specifically 50 epochs, proved crucial in optimizing the model's accuracy for identifying and classifying diseases in tomato leaves based on image data.




# Dataset Description

The dataset used for this project is a collection of labeled images of potato leaves, with three classes:

Tomato___Early_blight

Tomato___Late_blight

Tomato___healthy
